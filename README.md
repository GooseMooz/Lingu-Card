# Lingu/Card

An app for deep learning foreign words.

Powered by Flutter, NodeJS, and SQL.

## What is this for?

It is an analog of real-life flip cards that students usually use to remember vital information on some subject.

## How does it work?

Using SQL and NodeJS I created a database that contains words and their translations, and also an API to add/edit/delete new words. 
Using Flutter I created a mobile application for everything above. User can decide on how many random cards they want to study or edit their collection of words.
